            Creating and implementing the responsive redesign of our site was a huge undertaking involving most teams in our organization at Amex. However once the redesign was in place, front-end development and design efficiency and speed increased significantly. Even though the code base is still large and complex, at least it's just one code base. No more maintaining two separate sets or markup, styles and scripts for a mobile site.

            While we dove in 100% to responsive design from the start, we didn't get it perfect on day one. Our 1.0 delivery was clearly a MVP that we worked hard to make leaner and cleaner over time. Below are some screens of the site's dashboard along with some key discoveries we made on our path from responsive MVP to responsive greatness.
