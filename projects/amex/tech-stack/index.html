            Let's talk about tech. At Amex, I was a developer on the design team, not the engineering team. That means I have more than expected to offer from a design perspective, but that I wasn't asked to do certain things you might expect in a more traditional developer role (like write lots of unit tests, for example).
          </p>

          <p class="body-copy">
            So what can I offer your team immediately? Simple, legible HTML, solid Javascript (though not yet leadership level), quality image and workflow management, and leadership level SCSS and SCSS architecture. Not to mention my ability to hop into a sketching session, draw up some wireframes in Sketch, cut some assets or help align the technical architecture to the service journey.

          <h1>Workflow</h1>
          <h2>Git, Grunt, SCSS-Lint, JS-Hint</h2>
        </div> 

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>version control</i>, I've exclusively use Git. I was responsible for our team's code delivery into a TFS repository, but I didn't work in TFS from day to day.
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>build automation</i>, I implemented Grunt on our prototyping platform. I didn't get too crazy with it, but it did things like: run the static-site generator, compile SCSS, optimize SVG, display growl messages etc...
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>linting</i>, we implemented the standard JS-Hint for Javascript and less standard SCSS-Lint as an scss code styleguide. While SCSS-lint is more suggestive than it is strict, just the conversation it forced our team to have regarding code style was worthwhile.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I hope to keep using Git if possible. Grunt is fine, but after diving more into it's counterpart Gulp, I actually prefer the Gulp syntax. It's more concise and, I think, more legible in terms of showing each step of the build process. Linting is just broadly a good practice, but especially in larger teams I say: lint all the things!

          <h1>Markup</h1>
          <h2>HTML5, Jekyll, Liquid Templates, dust.js, Markdown</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          We used the static-site generator Jekyll as our base for prototyping and developing front-end code throughout the design process. We then delivered our HTML to an integrations team that chopped it up into C# views to run on our legacy ASP.NET platform. It's definitely not the best workflow, but we found that the design intent was better captured this way than it was previously when the design team handed off Adobe comps to developers 100% separated from the design process.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          As far as markup goes, I don't really have a strong prefence of technology. HTML is just kinda HTML. Templating languages are pretty much templating languages (just pick your desired curly brace syntax). I mostly hope to be in a place where the prototyping and final production environments are more similar.

          <h1>Styles</h1>
          <h2>SCSS, Compass, Atomic Design, BEM, ITCSS, PostCss</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          CSS architecture gets complicated really fast. In our case, we had to develop a way to develop three brands as close to simultaneously as possible, while allowing for some brand specific overwrites. We accomplished that by spinning off our own version of Brad Frost's Atomic Design pattern. We also gradually started phasing in Harry Roberts' version of BEM naming methodology. Both of these patterns were worth the effort to implement, but require a lot of team coordination to get it right.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          First off, I probably wouldn't use Ruby Sass and Compass again. Compass comes with tons of great features, but I'd probably use Grunt/Gulp workflows to build support for particular features rather than opting for Compass today. I do really like SCSS and plan on continuing to use it, though potentially making the switch to Libsass for faster build times. I'm also very curious about the growth of PostCSS and how it could improve my workflow.

          <h1>Javascript</h1>
          <h2>Vanilla, jQuery, Revealing Module Pattern, Interaction Library</h2>
        </div>
        
        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          My team owned the Javscript interaction library used across our platform, meaning that most of the Javascript I wrote used at least some jQuery and didn't often involve much data. I tended to write JS in the revealing module pattern, so feature functionality was always nicely wrapped and private by default but had the potential to reveal key pieces to other modules. So while I was not exclusively a Javascript developer, I worked in it routinely over each sprint but the intricacy varied a lot on the particular user story or project.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I would like to be in a place where I can work in Javascript more regularly. We didn't use one of the JS frameworks at Amex, but I'd like to chance to dive in to that world profesionally. Also, while I have written unit tests for Ruby code before, I'm interested in learning more about front-end unit testing.

          <h1>Images</h1>
          <h2>PNG, PNG Sprites, Compass Sprites, SVG, SVGO</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          Our site started with a ton of different resolution pngs floating around for all kinds of different elements, icons etc... Our first attempt at simplifying was using a Compass utility for auto generating 1x and 2x sprite sheets from two designated directories. This worked well for core ui elements, but really slowed down our build process.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          More recently we switched to using SVG almost exclusively. We haven't yet had the need to get into SVG spriting, since the images we're adding are mostly one off illustrations (not core ui). Also, due to our browser support requirements, we still have to make sure we include a 1x png fallback for those older browsers.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          Honestly, each image type has better and worse uses. I think leaning into SVG as the delivery method for icons and illustrations is generally a good choice for the web these days, but PNGs are still a good option. Ultimately, I'd try to pick the format that best maintains a particular visual's quality, while minimizing file size and simplifying maintenance.

          <h2>Project Euler, Side Projects</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I haven't used Ruby in any professional context, but it's still the first programming language I learned and the one that I go to for recreational programming like Project Euler. Ruby does a lot of things really well right out of the box, so it's fun to dig into all the built in methods. If only Javascript had a few more of those...
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I don't expect to end up writing much Ruby in my next job, but I'm game to jump in if that's what the team uses.
