            Redesigning the website using responsive design was a huge undertaking involving pretty much every team in our organization at American Express. However once the redesign was in place, overall development and design time decreased significantly. We consolidated the code base. So even though it was still a large and complex code base, at least we didn't have to maintain two entirely separate sets or markup, styles and scripts for a mobile site.
