           The Vroozi platform is a series of related but independent modules to help companies manage their spend. From creating a requisition for new goods or services, to sending purchase orders, to receiving those orders and processing the invoices to pay for them, Vroozi does it all. But as these modules were developed over time by engineers all over the globe, they never had a consistent design approach which left our experience feeling more like a catch-all than a command center.

            To make sure we were providing the most intuitive and natural navigation experience, I had to start with the most basic building blocks of the site: the data itself. I catalogued every piece of data on every page of the existing experience and mapped out the information architecture so I could workshop content groupings and site organization with my product team partners. I kept this 100% analog with post-its on foam core boards to keep everyone focused on the task at hand: correcting IA, content and navigation.
          </p>
          <p class="body-copy">
            Once we agreed on our updated architecture, I dove into prototyping a proof-of-concept portion of the experience with enough pages to start getting buy-in from our executive team.

            <p class="body-copy">
                As I prototyped my proof-of-concept with Sketch and InVision, I paid special attention to building on fundamental design patterns that our users already understood and relied on. While a completely clean slate is sometimes necessary, we didn't need a total overhaul of the platform. Instead I focused on refining stronger patterns and establishing the true UX and visual consistency we needed to deliver the strongest product. So with the new architecture as a base, I set out to evolve our look and feel in a way that tied the brand and the product together <i>(see the screens above as examples)</i>.
            </p>
            <p class="body-copy">
                 Especially in enterprise software, I believe the product needs to get out of the way and let the user get back to work. In most cases Vroozi users already had a previous system that they had become accustomed to using (regardless of how bad it might have been). So they're not looking to be wowed by my redesign of what already gets them through their workday. They just want something that's simple, that works and that let's them spend more time on their actual job, not on figuring out new software.
