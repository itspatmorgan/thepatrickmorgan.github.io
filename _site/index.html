          <b>I’m Patrick.</b> Professionally, I'm a front-end developer focused on how design meets technology. Personally, I'm a creative person that rarely goes a day without making something. I’m also apparently very pensive when I drink my coffee.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          For the last two years, I've worked as a part of a product design team at American Express where I’ve grown from handling smaller projects to being the front-end technical lead for large new feature development. While my end deliverable is almost always the front-end code itself, I enjoy working throughout the entire design process. In a previous life I was a brand strategist at Leo Burnett (a global ad agency), so I still enjoy a healthy dose of strategy to pair with my hours locked in on a text editor.

          My corner of the Amex universe revolved around the prepaid debit card platform, Serve. My team was responsible for the logged-in web experience of three brands on this platform: Amex Serve, Walmart Bluebird and Target Redcard. These three products are full-featured banking alternatives similar to the account you might have with a traditional bank like Chase or Wells Fargo (including bill pay, direct deposit, savings etc...). Check out the links below where I go into more detail on my tech skill set as well as highlight a few key findings from three projects.

          After two years as a brand strategist at Leo Burnett in Chicago, I realized I wasn't happy stopping my work at the point of deciding the strategy; I wanted to be responsible for its execution. Web development became my path toward satisfying my fundamental need to make things. So I quit my job, moved to New York and put myself through the ringer at General Assembly before finding my niche at Amex.

          I'm a big music fan, so for my final project at GA I developed a simple ranking app based on data from the Echonest, a super in-depth API that now powers a lot of Spotify features.

          My very first web app makes simple queries to the NY Times archives API. Search for your birthday! You're bound to find something interesting. Is this a great feat of engineering or design? Not by a long shot. But it's always fun to remember the humble beginnings.

          Yeah, I use a pseudonym. Deal with it. I've been involved with music for as long as I can remember. First came the piano lessons, then the years of choir, acappella groups and musicals and now I've honed in on music production and songwriting. So if you wanna chat about effect chains in Ableton Live, the lyric structure of that pop song you can't get out of your head or even if you just wanna have a good old fashioned jam session, I'm your man.

          I liked Rihanna's song "Stay", but always felt like it would've been better if it was a collab with Drake. So what did I do? I made the version I wanted to hear.
