I then worked as a front-end developer on a highly collaborative product design team at <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a> where I did everything from competitive audits, to field research, to user testing, to rapid prototyping, to building a responsive design system to work across three brands on our prepaid debit platform.

          My corner of the Amex universe revolved around the prepaid debit card platform, Serve. My team was responsible for the logged-in web experience of three brands on this platform: Amex Serve, Walmart Bluebird and Target Redcard. These three products are full-featured banking alternatives similar to the account you might have with a traditional bank like Chase or Wells Fargo (including bill pay, direct deposit, savings etc...). Check out the links below where I go into more detail on my tech skill set as well as highlight a few key findings from three projects.

        <p class="body-copy has-left-pipe">
          After two years as a strategist, I realized I wasn't happy just selling a product; I wanted to build one. Learning to code became my path to having a seat at the product development table. So I quit my job, moved to NYC and put myself through the grind at General Assembly before finding my niche at Amex.

        <p class="note">
          Please note: These are projects from my earliest days as a developer. They're fun to browse, but I've obviously learned a lot in the years since making them.

          I started my career as a brand strategist at one of the biggest ad agencies in the world. I translated all kinds of consumer research into communications and designs for Fortune 500 companies like Esurance, Sprint and MillerCoors. I learned a ton at Burnett: from managing the client/agency relationship to leading stakeholder interviews to developing a winning challenger strategy for a major brand. I also started learning to code on weeknights and weekends before making a leap of faith to become a professional developer.

          Yeah, I use a pseudonym. It's a nod to my little hometown of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. I've been involved with music for as long as I can remember. First came the piano lessons, then the years of choir, acappella groups and musicals and now I've honed in on music production and songwriting. So if you wanna chat about effect chains in Ableton Live, the lyric structure of that pop song you can't get out of your head or even if you just wanna have a good old fashioned jam session, I'm your man.
