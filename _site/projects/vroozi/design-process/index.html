           I’m the only designer at Vroozi for 30+ developers. We’re constantly developing new features, integrating third party tools, fixing bugs and generally moving at breakneck speed to keep the platform expanding. I've focused on creating tools and design process to ensure quality as we expand.

          <b>From Static Comps to Prototypes</b>
          <p class="body-copy">
            If I accomplish anything at Vroozi, I hope it’s this: make the company realize that the era of handing off static Photoshop comps is over. In my experience, they’re usually ineffective at capturing the level of detail necessary to convey the design intent of today's complex web applications. 
          </p>
          <p class="body-copy">
            While in my ideal world the design team would prototype in front-end code (like my previous team at American Express), I’ve found using <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> very useful for capturing my design ideas at a level of fidelity that ensures quality feedback from product stakeholders and quality build from the engineers. InVision now serves as our single source of truth for anyone at the company needing to reference a design; No more hunting down version X of project Y in so-and-so's email or Google Drive.

          <b>Creating Design Cadence & Communication</b>
          <p class="body-copy">
            I lead a few meetings to create a regular design cadence at Vroozi:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>A weekly design planning meeting</strong> where I meet with all the product owners to review, discuss and prioritize design support for their respective teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A weekly check-in with front-end development leads</strong> to make sure design intent is being captured in the front-end code. Also to learn from them what design patterns are working, not working, what they’d like to see fixed etc… They’re on the front lines and working in our design tech every day, so they truly feel which patterns are strong and which need work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A biweekly check-in with marketing and sales</strong>. I’m focused on our product design, but we need to make sure that our design approach is as seamless as possible between external facing properties and the product itself.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="body-copy">
            For workflow I settled on something Kanban-esque and use Trello to track design stories from backlog to release <i>(the image above)</i>. When I meet with the product team I take a couple stories off the top of the backlog and work on them until I have bandwidth to take on something else or until priorities change. At this size company, it's tough to plan longer term design efforts since priorities change too frequently and the appetite for multi-week or multi-month efforts is small. Using this Trello board along with routine, scheduled prioritizations has been effective for keeping projects movings while allocating appropriate time for the various stages of design support.

          <b>Centralizing Libraries and Templates</b>
          <p class="body-copy">
            Design systems involve a lot of different pieces: from global type styles, to sectional layouts, to component interactions, to icon sets and email templates. Lots of distinct pieces go into making a web product feel unified and function as a whole. With so many projects happening simultaneously, having core reference points for design is crucial.
          </p>
          <p class="body-copy">
            At Vroozi, I centralized and streamlined our icon set and unified our email and report templates to ensure consistency. Now if a product team member or a developer needs to see what we have already in our toolkit, they can quickly pull up these Sketch files from our shared Google Drive or see them at a glance in InVision. Especially in my current role, design must facilitate good communication between product and development and these kinds of library assets provide a strong base reference point for all those making product decisions.
