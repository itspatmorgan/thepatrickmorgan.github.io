           I’m the only designer at Vroozi against 30+ developers. We’re constantly developing new features, integrating third party tools, fixing bugs and generally moving at breakneck speed to keep the platform expanding to meet the needs of our existing enterprise customers (NBC Universal, Northrup Grumman) as well as sign new deals.

          <b>From static comps to prototypes</b>
          <p class="body-copy">
            If I accomplish anything at Vroozi, I hope it’s this: make the company realize that the era of static photoshop comps is over. They’re usually ineffective at capturing the level of depth necessary to convey the design intent of complex web applications. While in my ideal world the design team would prototype in front-end code (like my previous team at American Express), I’ve found using InVision very useful in capturing my design ideas at a level of fidelity that ensures quality feedback from product stakeholders and quality build from the engineers.

          <b>Creating Design Cadence & Communication</b>
          <p class="body-copy">
            I lead a few meetings to create a regular design cadence at the company:

            1. A weekly design planning meeting where I meet with all the product owners to review, discuss and prioritize the design support their respective teams need.
            2. A weekly check-in with front-end development leads to make sure design intent is being captured in the front-end code. Also to learn from them what design patterns are working, not working, what they’d like to see fixed etc… They’re on the front lines and working in our design tech every day, so they truly feel which patterns are strong and which need work.
            3. A biweekly check-in with marketing and sales. I’m focused on our product design, but we need to make sure that our design approach is as seamless as possible between external facing properties and our internal product itself.

            I settled on using a Kanban-esque workflow, where I take a couple stories off the top of the backlog and work on them until I have bandwidth to take on something else. As this size company, longer term projects are hard to plan. Priorities change too frequently and inevitably throw off our ability to plan a weeks-long or months-long project. Working on a two week sprint cycle also didn’t work, as the asks from the product team change in scope too much once we get going.
