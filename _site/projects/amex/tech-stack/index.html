          Let's talk shop. At Amex I was a developer on the design team, not the engineering team. That means I have more than often expected to offer from a design perspective, but that I wasn't asked to do certain things you might expect in a more traditional developer role (like write lots of unit tests, for example).
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy has-left-pipe">
          So what can I offer your team immediately? Intuitive, elegant user experiences backed by quality code, because internal quality is as important as external appearance. You'll get semantic HTML, quality asset and workflow management, leadership level SCSS and SCSS architecture and solid Javascript (though not yet leadership level). Not to mention my ability to hop into a sketching session, draw up wireframes, cut assets or help define the user journey.

        </div> 

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>version control</i>, I've only used Git. I was responsible for our team's code delivery into a TFS repository, but I didn't work in TFS from day to day.
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>build automation</i>, I implemented Grunt on our prototyping platform. I didn't get too crazy with it, but it did things like: run the static-site generator, compile SCSS, optimize SVGs, display growl messages etc... Check out my <a href="https://gist.github.com/patrickmmorgan/405e661a0b567e99ec2f83ffea0b42b3" target="_blank">Gruntfile</a> or <a href="https://github.com/patrickmmorgan/patrickmmorgan.github.io/blob/master/gulpfile.js">Gulpfile</a>
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          For <i>linting</i>, we implemented the standard JS-Hint for Javascript and less standard SCSS-Lint and CSSComb as a code styleguide. SCSS-lint is more suggestive than it is strict, but the conversation it forced our team to have regarding code style was just as worthwhile as the actual tool. Check out my <a href="https://gist.github.com/patrickmmorgan/8430fb88b5803ad6305255b721fd08ab" target="_blank">SCSS-Lint config</a>.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I'd prefer to keep using Git for versioning if possible. Grunt is solid, but after diving more into it's counterpart Gulp, I actually prefer the Gulp syntax. It's more concise and, I think, more legible in terms of showing each step of the build process. As far as linting is concerned I pretty much just say, lint all the things!

        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          We used the static-site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> as our base for prototyping and developing front-end code throughout the design process. We then delivered our HTML and templates to an integrations team that chopped them up into C# views to run on our legacy ASP.NET platform. It wasn't a great delivery strategy, but the benefits of developing the front-end code in the midst of the broader design process outweighed its awkwardness.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          As far as markup goes, I don't have a strong prefence of technology. HTML is just kinda HTML. Templating languages are pretty much templating languages (just pick your desired curly brace syntax). I mostly hope to be in a place where the prototyping and production environments are more closely aligned.

          <h2>CSS, SCSS, Compass, Atomic Design, BEM, ITCSS, PostCSS</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          CSS architecture gets complicated fast. In our case we needed to find a way to develop three brands in parallel while allowing for some unique, brand specific overrides. We accomplished that by spinning off our own version of Brad Frost's <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a> pattern. We also phased in Harry Roberts' less strict version of the<a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/" target="_blank">BEM naming methodology</a>. Both of these patterns required a lot of team coordination to get right, but they were worth the effort to implement.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          On a large project I probably wouldn't use Ruby Sass with Compass again. Compass comes with a ton of features, but you have to take its baggage too. Going forward I'd probably use Grunt/Gulp workflows to build support for particular pre-processing features. I do really like SCSS syntax and plan on continuing to use it, though I'd potentially switch to Libsass for faster build times. So really my ideal approach for pre-processing would be similar to the <a href="http://postcss.org/" target="_blank">PostCSS</a> methodology.

          <h2>Vanilla, jQuery, Interaction Library, Revealing Module Pattern</h2>
        </div>
        
        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          My team owned the Javascript interaction library used across the Serve platform, meaning that most of the Javascript I wrote for Amex focused on animation, used at least some jQuery and didn't often involve dynamic data. I mostly wrote standalone modules in the revealing module pattern in order to keep feature functionality nicely wrapped while allowing for key pieces to be re-used by other modules. So although I wasn't exclusively a Javascript developer, I worked in it routinely over each sprint and have a solid base for launching into the JS framework world at the enterprise level.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          I would like to be in a place where I can do more Javascript development. We didn't use one of the JS frameworks at Amex, but I'd like to get into that world profesionally. Also, while I have written <a href="https://github.com/patrickmmorgan/ruby-code-sample" target="_blank">unit tests for Ruby</a>before, I'm interested in learning more about front-end testing. I can contribute quality JS immediately, but am hoping to find a good mentor to help me take it to the next level.

          <h1>Images</h1>
          <h2>SVG, SVGO, PNG, PNG Sprites, Compass Sprites</h2>
        </div>

        <b>What have I done?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          Our site started with a ton of different resolution pngs floating around for all kinds of different elements, icons etc... Our first attempt at simplifying was using a <a href="https://blog.gaya.ninja/articles/retina-sprites-for-compass/">Compass utility</a> for auto generating 1x and 2x sprite sheets from two designated image directories. This worked well for core ui elements, but ultimately slowed down our build process quite a bit.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          More recently we switched to using SVG for most new icons and illustrations. We haven't yet had the need to get into SVG spriting, since we're mostly adding one off images (not core ui). I have put a good amount of work into understanding SVG optimization. The <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO utility</a> has a CLI as well as grunt/gulp plugins, but my preferred method is <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">this GUI</a>. The optimized output can vary a lot depending on choices the designer makes while creating the SVG in a program like Illustrator or Sketch (groups, masks etc...), so I find it useful to confirm the optimization visually before committing to different options. SVG support is pretty widespread now, but for older browsers (IE8, older Android) we still include a 1x png fallback for each image.
        </p>

        <b>What would I like to do?</b>
        <p class="body-copy">
          Each image type has better and worse uses. I think leaning into SVG as the delivery method for icons and illustrations is generally a good choice for the web these days, but PNGs are still useful to be sure. Ultimately, I'd try to pick the format that best maintains a particular visual's quality, while minimizing file size and simplifying maintenance.

          I haven't used Ruby in any professional context, but it's still the first programming language I learned and my go to for recreational programming like <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>. Ruby does a lot of things really well right out of the box, so it's fun to dig into all the built in methods. If only Javascript had a few more of those...
