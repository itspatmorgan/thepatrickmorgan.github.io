        <p>Okay, you caught me. I like to make things. Like this site, for instance.</p>

        <p>I like making things so much that I chose to leave my job as a brand strategist and dive into the wonderful world of code. Because, at the end of the day, my ideas aren't of much use to anyone if they never make it out of my notebook. So take a look around, drop me a line, and let's get back to the making.</p>
