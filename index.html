          I’m Patrick. A front-end developer with a passion for design and technology. I’m also apparently very pensive when I drink my coffee.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          At Amex I've worked as a part of a product design team where I’ve grown from independently handling smaller projects to being the front-end technical lead for large new feature development. While my end deliverable is almost always the front-end code itself, I enjoy working throughout the entire design process. In a previous life I was a brand strategist at Leo Burnett (a global ad agency), so I still enjoy a healthy dose of strategy work to pair with my hours locked in on a text editor.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          So if you need a technologist that's at his best when he's on the edge of design and engineering, please look me up! I'm moving to Los Angeles in June 2016 and am looking for a new team to join.
