          I’m Patrick. A front-end developer with a passion for design and technology. I’m also apparently very pensive when I drink my coffee.
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          At Amex I've worked as a part of a product design team where I’ve grown from independently handling smaller projects to being the front-end technical lead for large new feature development. While my end deliverable is almost always the front-end code itself, I enjoy working throughout the entire design process. In a previous life I was a brand strategist at Leo Burnett (a global ad agency), so I still enjoy a healthy dose of strategy work to pair with my hours locked in on a text editor.
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          So if you need a technologist that's at his best when he's on the edge of design and engineering, please look me up! I'm moving to Los Angeles in June 2016 and am looking for a new team to join.

        <p class="body-copy has-left-pipe">
          Over the last year, I put extra focus on researching front-end best practices and helping them find their way into our legacy code base. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt">Grunt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/">SCSS-lint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js">CSScomb</a> helped us automate mundane tasks and spend more time building a better experience. Better class naming strategy and abstraction patterns helped us simplify our code for better reuse over time. The goal is to drastically simplify the front-end code which will let us prototype more efficiently, deliver a more consistently excellent user experience and maintain cleaner code in production. That means less bug fixing, fewer workarounds, and more productivity all around – never a bad thing.

          Want a demo? I'm happy to demo any of my Amex work, but I unfortunately can't post open links or code due to confidentiality agreements.

          After two years as a brand strategist at Leo Burnett, I realized I wasn't happy stopping my work at the point of creating the strategy; I wanted to be responsible for its execution. Web development became my path toward satisfying my fundamental need to make things. So I quit my job, moved to New York and put myself through the ringer at General Assembly before finding my niche at Amex.

          Please note: These are projects from my earliest days as a developer. They're fun to browse, but I've obviously learned a lot in the 2+ years since making them.

          I'm a big music fan, so for my final project at GA I developed a simple ranking app based on data from the Echonest, a super in-depth API that now powers a lot of features for Spotify. I had fun with this one and could definitely see myself building something new with the Echonest API in the future.
