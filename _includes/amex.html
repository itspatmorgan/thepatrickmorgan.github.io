          My corner of the Amex universe revolved around the prepaid debit card platform, Serve. My team was responsible for the logged-in web experience of three brands on this platform: Amex Serve, Walmart Bluebird and Target Redcard. These three products are full-featured banking alternatives similar to the account you might have with a traditional bank like Chase or Wells Fargo (including bill pay, direct deposit, savings etc...). Check out the links below where I go into more detail on my tech skill set as well as highlight a few key findings from three projects.

        <p class="note">
          Want a demo? I'm happy to demo any of my code from Amex, but unfortunately I'm limited in what I can post online due to confidentiality agreements.
