        <p class="body-copy has-left-pipe">
          Over the last year, I put extra focus on researching front-end best practices and helping them find their way into our legacy code base. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt">Grunt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/">SCSS-lint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js">CSScomb</a> helped us automate mundane tasks and spend more time building a better experience. Better class naming strategy and abstraction patterns helped us simplify our code for better reuse over time. The goal is to drastically simplify the front-end code which will let us prototype more efficiently, deliver a more consistently excellent user experience and maintain cleaner code in production. That means less bug fixing, fewer workarounds, and more productivity all around â€“ never a bad thing.

          Want a demo? I'm happy to demo any of my Amex work, but I unfortunately can't post open links or code due to confidentiality agreements.
