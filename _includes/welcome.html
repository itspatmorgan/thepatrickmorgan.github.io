          <b>Iâ€™m Patrick.</b> Professionally, I'm a designer focused on how design and tech come together to make great products. Personally, I'm a creative person that rarely goes a day without making something. I'm apparently also very pensive when I drink my coffee.

          In this era of blurring job titles, I'm definitely a hybrid. Yes, I've written production ready front-end code, but I thrive on working throughout a full human-centered design process. I've been a brand strategist at a <a href="http://leoburnett.com/">global ad agency</a>, a design technologist on a product design team at <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a> and now the main product designer at a startup, so I have a broad range of skills at hand to push the creative development of your product.

          I'm currently working for <a href="https://www.vroozi.com/">Vroozi</a>, a fin-tech startup in Los Angeles, where I'm helping to refine a business puchasing platform that processed well over a billion dollars of B2B spend last year.
