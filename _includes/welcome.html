          <b>I’m Patrick.</b> Professionally, I'm a UI developer focused on how design meets technology. Personally, I'm a creative person that rarely goes a day without making something. I’m also apparently very pensive when I drink my coffee.

        <p class="body-copy">
          For the last two years, I've worked on a product design team at American Express where I’ve grown from handling smaller projects to being the front-end technical lead for large new feature development. While my end deliverable is almost always the front-end code itself, I enjoy working throughout the entire design process. Before getting into tech I was a brand strategist at Leo Burnett (a global ad agency), so I still enjoy a healthy dose of strategy to pair with my hours locked in on a text editor.

          If you need a technologist that's at his best on the edge of engineering and design, please look me up!
