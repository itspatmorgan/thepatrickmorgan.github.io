          At Vroozi I'm the only full-time designer, so I'm responsible for and do pretty much everything design-wise. I really do a bit of everything in this role: I work with my product team partners to gather requirements, I might lead us in experience design and research activities, I might create an InVision prototype, I might do visual design exploration, I might create a content matrix for a new feature, or I might just hop into the code base to fix a bug. Ultimately, I do what's needed to communicate the design intent.

          Vroozi is a unified suite of financial products but our home base admin panel never felt like it. I'm working on taking it from being a feature-rich catch-all to a true command center.

          As the only designer at Vroozi, not all design work can (or should) go through me. I canâ€™t be the bottleneck to delivering a great product. So a big goal of mine has been to create tools and processes for our development and product team to use as they inevitably make their own design decisions.
