        <p class="body-copy has-left-pipe">
          After two years as a strategist, I realized I wasn't happy just selling a product; I wanted to build one. Learning to code became my path to having a seat at the product development table. So I quit my job, moved to NYC and put myself through the grind at General Assembly before finding my niche at Amex.

        <p class="note">
          Please note: These are projects from my earliest days as a developer. They're fun to browse, but I've obviously learned a lot in the years since making them.

          I'm a big music fan, so for my final project at GA I developed a simple ranking app based on data from the Echonest, a super in-depth API that now powers a lot of Spotify's features.

          My very first web app makes simple queries to the NY Times archives API. Search for your birthday! You're bound to find something interesting. Is this a great feat of engineering or design? Not by a long shot. But it's always fun to remember the humble beginnings.
