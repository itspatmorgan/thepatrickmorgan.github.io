          Yeah, I use a pseudonym. Deal with it. I've been involved with music for as long as I can remember. First came the piano lessons, then the years of choir, acappella groups and musicals and now I've honed in on music production and songwriting. So if you wanna chat about effect chains in Ableton Live, the lyric structure of that pop song you can't get out of your head or even if you just wanna have a good old fashioned jam session, I'm your man.

          I've started putting more focus on writing songs for an upcoming EP, but in the meantime I'm releasing the back tracks once they're in a presentable place.

          I heavily re-worked the Nas classic "If I Ruled The World", sampling Humphrey Bogart and his even-more-classic "Maltese Falcon".

          I liked Rihanna's song "Stay", but always felt like it would've been better if it was a collab with Drake. So what did I do? I made the version I wanted to hear.
