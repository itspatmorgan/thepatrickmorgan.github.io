          I've been involved with music for as long as I can remember. First came the piano lessons, then the years of choir, acappella groups and musicals and now I've honed in on music production and songwriting. So if you wanna chat about effect chains in Ableton Live, the lyric structure of that pop song you can't get out of your head or even if you just wanna have a good 'ole acoustic jam session, I'm your man.

          I heavily re-worked the Nas classic "If I Ruled The World", sampling clips from Humphrey Bogart and his even-more-classic "Maltese Falcon".

          Yeah, Jared Leto is pretty eccentric, but his music backs it up. I remixed 30 Second to Mars' "Kings and Queens" with a Tropical House vibe.

          I set out to use a wobble bass and pull in some carribean vibe a la Diplo and ended up with a solid Reggaeton-esque dance beat.
