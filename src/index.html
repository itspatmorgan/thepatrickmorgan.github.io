          <b>I’m Patrick.</b> Professionally, I'm a front-end developer focused on how design meets technology. Personally, I'm a creative person that rarely goes a day without making something. I’m also apparently very pensive when I drink coffee.
        </p>

        <p class="body-copy">
          At Amex I've worked as a part of a product design team where I’ve grown from independently handling smaller projects to being the front-end technical lead for large new feature development. While my end deliverable is almost always the front-end code itself, I enjoy working throughout the entire design process. In a previous life I was a brand strategist at Leo Burnett (a global ad agency), so I still enjoy a healthy dose of strategy to pair with my hours locked in on a text editor.
        </p>

          If you need a technologist that's at his best on the edge of engineering and design, please look me up! <i>I'm moving to Los Angeles in June 2016 and am looking for a new team to join.</i>
